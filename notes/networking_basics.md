## Anomaly Detection (Rule-Based)

Before applying machine learning, systems often use
rule-based detection to identify abnormal behavior.

Examples:
- Frequent ERROR logs
- Repeated packet loss
- Connection timeouts

These signals can later be converted into features for ML models.

## Feature Extraction for ML

Raw system logs must be converted into numerical features
before being used by machine learning models.

Examples:
- Error count
- Warning count
- Packet loss frequency
- Timeout frequency

Feature engineering directly impacts ML model performance.
