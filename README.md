Current Implementation:
- Log file ingestion
- Event parsing
- Rule-based anomaly detection
- Summary reporting

Next Steps:
- Feature extraction
- Statistical thresholds
- ML-based anomaly detection

Data Pipeline:
Logs → Parsed Events → Feature Extraction → Anomaly Detection

Features Extracted:
- Total events
- Error count
- Warning count
- Packet loss count
- Timeout count
